            <p> Francine Moka has always been a coffee fanatic, starting at a young age when she tried her grandmothers homebrew coffee. While many considered her addicted to Coffee, she felt that she was creating a work of art, wether it be making a homemade latte or a simple premade brew from a Keurig. </p>
            
            <p>After graduating from University of Pittsburgh in 2013, Moka instantly began taking business jobs across the country, traveling and moving not only to find work, but also to see what other people were doing that made their small businesses successful. After being layed off in 2017, Moka decided that it was now or never to open her own business, and to quit relying on others. With investments from friends and family and savings she was able to accumulate, Moka bought the small storefront in Downtown Atlanta, and ever since, there's been no turning back for Cafe Moka and the young entrepreneur. </p>

            <p> Even though Moka was hesitant on the idea of people helping her make coffee, worrying that it would loose its charm, she quickly realized that she was going to need help around the shop. Despite being weary that outside help would wear down the quality and special feeling Francine Moka worked so hard to perfect, she still believes that her workers were the best choices for the job, and keep the magic of Cafe Moka vibrant and youthful. Below we have listed our full-time employees to thank them for their service and assistance around the Cafe.</p>
